![RootGuard WebApp – One interface for your DNS stack](assets/rootguard-webapp-social-preview.png)

**RootGuard WebApp is the secure browser interface for the RootGuard
self-hosted DNS stack.** It provides guided setup, service health, Unbound
configuration, AdGuard Home access, updates, rollback, and local password
recovery without receiving the Docker socket.

cd backend
ROOTGUARD_CORE_URL=http://localhost:8081 \
ROOTGUARD_API_TOKEN=development-token \
ROOTGUARD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=replace-with-a-strong-password \
ROOTGUARD_RECOVERY_TOKEN=separate-long-random-recovery-key \
go run ./cmd/rootguard-webapp
```

### Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Run the checks before opening a pull request:

```sh
cd backend && go test ./...
cd ../frontend && npm ci && npm run lint && npm run build
```

The full RootGuard development stack is available from the
[main repository](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard).

## Architecture and security

The Go backend owns authentication, sessions, same-origin checks, API proxying,
and static frontend delivery. The React frontend contains presentation and
guided workflows.

- No Docker socket or arbitrary host command execution.
- HttpOnly, SameSite-Strict sessions.
- Internal Core and updater calls use a separate API token.
- Distroless runtime image and deterministic frontend build.
- Password resets require an independent local recovery token, store only a
  salted verifier, and invalidate existing sessions.

The complete trust model is documented in the
[RootGuard architecture](https://github.com/foxly-it/rootguard/blob/main/docs/architecture.md).
